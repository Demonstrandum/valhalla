# Valhalla Compiler Test

A series of good and bad files are run, to see if the compiler
ends up returning an error or not.  These tests serve to see if
the compiler is implemented correctly.

It is however by no means very extensive right now, and will need
to continue to be expanded on.

## Failure

Most tests for successful compilation at the will fail,
this is because most of the compiler features are only half
implemented or so.  The standard library / prelude is also lacking,
which makes this worse.
